    <h1 class="title">A Case for UGSDW for All</h1>
</div>


# Introduction

As Grinnellians, we all deeply cherish Grinnell College’s commitment to
academic excellence, educational equity, social responsibility, and
self-governance. Despite claims by Grinnell College and its attorneys, UGSDW
expansion will not harm the core mission of Grinnell College. In fact, we seek
to build a lasting structure for mutual cooperation and accountability between
all student workers and the College, and we will continue to realize and
effectuate Grinnell’s core mission.
 
Advocacy always has a deeply emotional dimension. We are profoundly shocked and
disappointed by the College’s decision to spend its precious institutional
resources aggressively crusading against our efforts with the aid of
high-powered law firms which specialize in union busting.[^1] But it is often easy
to get caught up in the emotions of the moment. Grinnellians ask hard questions
and question easy answers.  In this spirit, we lay out the following facts:

<div class="text-banner" style="margin: 1em 10% 1em 0">

Expansion would have an extremely limited financial impact on Grinnell College.

### Due to inflation and tuition increases, real wages for student workers have been consistently decreasing for almost a decade.

Most student workers rely on their campus jobs to finance their Grinnell
education. In 2008, if a student worked a job that paid the campus minimum wage
for 8 hours a week, their annual income from campus employment would equal
roughly 4.4 percent of the comprehensive fee.[^2] Today, income from the same
job would only equal roughly 3.1 percent of the comprehensive fee—a 30%
decrease.[^3] In addition, the campus minimum wage in 2008 is worth more than
$8.50 per hour in 2018 dollars, compared to the current campus minimum wage
of $8.00 per hour.[^4] In essence, the college has been saving money (in real
terms) on student wages each year.   It is disingenuous for it to claim that it
could not afford a higher (real) level of wages.

### Grinnell College has the financial capacity to pay student workers a fair wage. 

President Kington frequently claims that Grinnell College could not afford
UGSDW expansion because the College “is a non-profit” or “does not turn a
profit,” while Grinnell College has achieved consistent financial success. Over
the past 10 years, Grinnell College has realized an average net revenue of over
$20 million.[^5] For fiscal year (“FY”) 2018, gifts and donations totaled $17.1
million, “easily” the highest since FY 2010.[^6] Student wages account for less
than 1.5 percent of Grinnell’s total operating costs, and wage increases UGSDW
are prepared to negotiate would cost the College a small percentage on top of
that 1.5 percent.[^7] [^8] There have certainly been times when the college faced
harder budgetary constraints. In FY 2009 and FY 2016, Grinnell College posted
net losses of around $152 million and $15 million, respectively,[^9] but in 2008
(during FY 2009), because of an increase in the federal minimum wage, the
College raised the campus minimum wage from $6.8 per hour to $7.25 per
hour.[^10] [^11] Despite these challenges, the College was able to maintain spending
on strategic priorities, such as financial aid and campus employment
opportunities.[^12] The notion that UGSDW expansion would limit resources for
these priorities is factually questionable; the fact that these arguments are
made by lawyers whose hourly rates may well exceed $1,000 is especially
troubling.[^13]

Finally, the claim that the College will cut financial aid and job
opportunities in response to UGSDW expansion is irresponsible, retaliatory, and
possibly illegal.  Grinnell admits students on a  need-blind basis, and meets
100% of demonstrated financial need.  These policies cannot be changed by
administrative fiat; they are commitments made by the Board of Trustees, and
renewed every three years.  Grinnell’s administration simply could not
unilaterally cut financial aid in order to “balance the books.”  Furthermore,
any retaliatory cuts to financial aid  (or retaliation in any form) as a result
of student unionization is a violation of federal labor law.[^14]

UGSDW has a positive influence on student workers’ education.
</h1>
</div>

### We have always actively emphasized our role as students of Grinnell College.

However, Grinnell College has charged that UGSDW expansion would “impede
learning” by “fundamentally changing the educational relationship between the
College, faculty, and students.”[^15]  This simply has not been the case, during
the over two years that UGSDW has represented student workers in Dining
Services.  In fact, UGSDW’s current Dining contract reads, in part, “The
College and Union mutually agree and acknowledge that the employees covered by
this Agreement are, first and foremost, students” (emphasis added).[^16] Student
workers having a powerful say in our workplace by no means hinders the rigorous
academics Grinnell is renowned for.

### Research finds no evidence that unions of student workers harm education. 

In fact, a random sample of liberal arts and sciences professors from five
universities “generally do not believe that their relationships with students
have suffered because of collective bargaining.”[^17] Similarly, a 2013 study,
examining student-faculty relationships, academic freedom, and economic
well-being across unionized and non-unionized campuses, found that unionization
does not interfere with faculty-student relationships or harm the education of
students.[^18]

### A union of student workers can facilitate academic learning. 

The same 2013 study discussed above shows that student workers in unions report
a higher level of personal and professional support.[^19] Furthermore, regardless
of potential educational benefits of campus employment, working too much hurts
the learning experience of student workers. Around 1250 of Grinnell’s 1700
students work each year.[^20] Many of our members work 20 hours a week to be able
to afford tuition, fees, and living expenses—time they cannot spend on
academics and extracurriculars. 
 
### Better working conditions are better learning conditions. 

Like any life experience, campus employment involves an educational aspect, but
student workers cannot fully realize these educational benefits if they are
underpaid, if they fear discrimination, if they fear inadvertently hurting
themselves, and if they fear being fired without just cause. UGSDW embraces the
educational value of campus employment, as well as the flexibility of Grinnell
College in creating and improving job opportunities locally, but we maintain
that everyone deserves a fair wage, that everyone deserves a fair discipline
policy, that everyone deserves dignity at work, and that everyone deserves a
say in their own workplace.

UGSDW is committed to student workers’ privacy.
</h1>
</div>

Grinnell College has erroneously claimed that UGSDW expansion would “require”
them to give confidential information of student workers protected by FERPA and
other higher education laws to UGSDW.[^21]  Tellingly, in good faith we have
approached the College administration with concrete proposals to guarantee
student workers’ privacy rights, only to be stonewalled and ridiculed by
them.[^22] [^23] [^24]
 
Indeed, effective advocacy requires sufficient evidence and information. The
National Labor Relations Act does require employers to provide unions with
information relevant to collective bargaining. However, the vast majority of
information UGSDW needs, such as how many student workers work are in each pay
category, is not individually identifiable and thus not confidential. In the
rare cases where individual information is necessary, such as wrongful
termination, UGSDW will never pursue any individual information without the
affirmative consent from the student worker in question. Student workers own
their privacy rights; Grinnell College does not. Privacy rights should not be
weaponized as an excuse to deny student workers their rights to organize in
unions.

# Conclusion

When pressed to explain how exactly UGSDW expansion would harm Grinnell’s core
mission, President Kington demurred that “It’s sort of circular—It’s part of
our core mission  because it’s part of the core mission.” After two days of
testimony by administrators and students, including a 2-hour presentation by
President Kington himself, the Regional Director of NLRB concluded: 
 
> The Employer’s contentions about how collective bargaining would affect
> financial aid, limit the number of jobs available to students, interfere with
> the ability to hire qualified students, negatively impact the egalitarian
> culture of the college, and otherwise undermine the college’s mission are
> speculative and not based on any concrete evidence.[^25]
 
Faced with this unequivocal finding, Grinnell College doubled down on these
assertions and insisted on appealing the decision to the National Labor Board,
stacked with anti-worker appointees of the Trump administration. This
insensible decision by Grinnell College risks the rights of not only more than
a thousand student workers in Grinnell but also hundreds of thousands of
student workers cross the nation to join together to advocate for themselves in
unions.[^26]
 
As one commentator on student worker struggles noted, “It’s telling that
professional academics, committed to ruthless empiricism and logic, are reduced
to mystical, even spiritual platitudes when pressed to explain their opposition
to [student] unionism.”[^27] Since October, UGSDW has demanded to meet the senior
leadership of Grinnell College so as to reach a swift and fair resolution, but
the administration refuses. To this day, UGSDW remains willing to an open
dialogue and a compromise with the College, and our fight for all working
students carries on.
