# Why a union?

Workers deserve a voice. Without student workers, there would be no food, no
library, no mentor sessions, no mail delivery. We do vital work for the
college. Some students work 20 hours a week. We should have a say in how we
work.

Grinnell has always valued self-governance. College president George Gates 
famously said that "It is 10,000 times better that young people should learn to 
govern themselves." Despite this, self-governance is notably absent in 
the workplace. Wages and hours are set arbitrarily by the administration, and
[jobs can disappear without notice or discussion](/2017/08/26/statement-on-the-closing-of-bob-s-underground-cafe-and-lyle-s-pub/).

UGSDW can provide a voice to student workers. Together, we can advocate for our
common goals in a way that has not been possible before. We have an opportunity
to fundamentally rethink the relationship between student labor and the college. 
We can make Grinnell the most unionized campus in the country, a place where 
democracy and fair wages are the rule rather than the exception.

# Our Platform

If students choose to be represented by UGSDW, we will begin negotiating a
contract with Grinnell.  First, we'll survey our members and hold meetings
to decide bargaining priorities.  A bargaining comitee comprised of workers
from across campus will then sit down with college administrators and 
negotiate over wages, benefits, rules, and more.

In our discussions with student workers, several key issues have come up again
and again. These are issues that will be central to our first contract campaign:

- **A campus-wide minimum wage of $10.00 an hour.** Tuition and fees keep
rising, but wages are raised infrequently and arbitrarily.  It's time to bring
Grinnell into the 21st century and start paying fair wages.

- **Explicit non-discrimination provisions and a fair discipline procedure.**  
Grinnell's existing discrimination procedures have proved inadequate in 
addressing workplace issues.  Additionally, a lack of a fair and consistent
discipline procedure has led to 
[wrongful mass firings](/2018/07/14/ugsdw-wins-reinstatement-of-student-employees/).

- **Leave for illness and other emergencies.** While the college has stated that
they reserve the right to fire employees for being "too sick," we believe
that leave for medical treatment, family emergencies, and illness is a basic
right.  Giving employees one paid sick day a semester would discourage them
from working while sick and endangering their peers.
