# Why a union?

Grinnell has always valued self-governance. College president George Gates 
famously said that "It is 10,000 times better that young people should learn to 
govern themselves." Despite this, self-governance is notably absent in 
the workplace. Wages and hours are set arbitrarily by the administration, and
[jobs can disappear without notice or discussion](/2017/08/26/statement-on-the-closing-of-bob-s-underground-cafe-and-lyle-s-pub/).

![Expansion announcement](/assets/news/expansion_watching.jpg)

UGSDW can provide a voice to student workers. Together, we can advocate for our
common goals in a way that has not been possible before. We have an opportunity
to radically rethink the relationship between student labor and the college. We
can make Grinnell the most unionized campus in the country, a place where 
democracy rules over fiat, where fair wages are the rule rather than the
exception.

# Why *this* &nbsp;union?

Unlike other unions for graduate and undergraduate workers, UGSDW is not
affiliated with any national or international union. We're entirely 
democratic and student-run.  Relying on voluntary dues and volunteered time,
we've taken on one of the wealthiest colleges in the country and won large
raises, negotiated new worker protections, and improved the quality of service
in the dining hall. It's time to bring the benefits of unionization to the
rest of campus.

<div class="text-banner" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1em 0">
&ldquo;Student workers can shape the college that they serve. The fight to increase
dining hall wages is an amazing and powerful example of we can do when we
combine our voices in the name of student power.&rdquo;

### What about dues?

UGSDW has no mandatory dues. For those who are willing and able, we [suggest
monthly dues of $2.00](/members/dues/) to help pay for things like our 
website, printing, mailing, and food. 
There are no dues in January, June, July, and August.

# I don't want to get fired.

It's illegal for Grinnell to retaliate or discriminate against you in any way
for union activity.  There's an entire government agency, the [National Labor
Relations Board](http://www.nlrb.gov), dedicated to protecting 
[your right](/members/rights) to have a say at work.

We don't send the College a list of our members.  Your name and signature will
be reviewed and counted by a neutral third party or the NLRB.


# How does expansion work?

We've [challenged](/assets/news/open_letter.pdf) the Grinnell administration to 
sign a [Neutrality and Card Check Agreement](/assets/news/neutrality.pdf),
which would force the college to remain neutral throughout the process, and to
recognize the union once we've received the support of a majority of student
workers.

To show your support, simply [join the union](/join). Once we reach 50%, we
can bargain a contract.
