Student workers deserve a say. That's why we are joining together at UGSDW.

# Why a union?

Workers deserve a voice. Without student workers, there would be no food, no
library, no mentor sessions, no mail delivery. We do vital work for the
college. We should have a say in how we
work.

Grinnell has always valued self-governance. College president George Gates 
famously said that "It is 10,000 times better that young people should learn to 
govern themselves." Despite this, self-governance is notably absent in 
the workplace. Wages and hours are set arbitrarily by the administration, and
[jobs can disappear without notice or discussion](/2017/08/26/statement-on-the-closing-of-bob-s-underground-cafe-and-lyle-s-pub/). 

Together, we can advocate for our common goals in a way that has not been possible before. Student workers in Dining Services have fought for, and won, [key improvements](https://www.ugsdw.org/2019/06/10/student-dining-workers-ratify-new-contract-with-grinnell-college-for-academic-year-2019-2020/) in wages and working conditions through UGSDW. Student workers outside Dining Services ought to have the right to do the same.

# Partial Expansion

<div class="text-banner" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1em 0">
&ldquo;We will fight to get to partial expansion. We will fight for all student workers, with or without formal union representation, in or out of partial expansion.&rdquo;

Ever since we announced our campaign to expand union representation beyond Dining Services, the college administration fought us at every turn, [saying](https://www.ugsdw.org/2017/11/16/grinnell-s-anti-worker-agenda/) that student workers do not deserve any labor rights, [lawyering up](https://www.ugsdw.org/2018/11/19/statement-on-nov-19-special-campus-memo/), and [threatening](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/grinnell-college-union-nlrb-national-labor-relations-board/) the rights of student workers across the country.

Yet, student workers continued to organize, [take](https://www.ugsdw.org/2018/12/14/grinnell-college-sent-backpedaling-after-successful-student-demonstration/) direct action, and [offer](https://www.ugsdw.org/2019/02/09/our-letter-to-the-board-of-trustees/) to discuss the administration’s concerns in good faith. In [February 2019](https://www.ugsdw.org/2019/02/21/statement-on-feb-21-special-campus-memo/), UGSDW members made the difficult decision to agree to expand representation to jobs that were not “primarily educational” first. In May 2019, we again made a difficult decision to agree to a partial expansion proposal from the administration that would commit the college not to resist union expansion to 200+ student workers outside Dining, including those in Mail Services and Athletics.  

But the trustees continued to deny student workers’ rights, delaying a vote on the deal in [May](https://www.ugsdw.org/2019/05/08/moving-backward-statement-on-may-7-student-campus-memo/) and [October](https://www.ugsdw.org/2019/09/28/statement-on-board-of-trustees-delay-of-vote-on-partial-expansion/), 2019. We will fight to get to partial expansion. We will fight for all student workers, with or without formal union representation, in or out of partial expansion.

# Our Platform

If students choose to be represented by UGSDW, we will begin negotiating a
contract with Grinnell.  First, we'll survey our members and hold meetings
to decide bargaining priorities.  A bargaining comittee comprised of workers
from across campus will then sit down with college administrators and 
negotiate over wages, benefits, rules, and more.

In our discussions with student workers, several key issues have come up again
and again. These are issues that will be central to our first contract campaign:

- **A campus-wide minimum wage of $10.00 an hour.** Tuition and fees keep
rising, but wages are raised infrequently and arbitrarily.  It's time to bring
Grinnell into the 21st century and start paying fair wages.

- **Explicit non-discrimination provisions and a fair discipline procedure.**  
Grinnell's existing discrimination procedures have proved inadequate in 
addressing workplace issues.  Additionally, a lack of a fair and consistent
discipline procedure has led to 
[wrongful mass firings](/2018/07/14/ugsdw-wins-reinstatement-of-student-employees/).

- **Leave for illness and other emergencies.** While the college has stated that
they reserve the right to fire employees for being "too sick," we believe
that leave for medical treatment, family emergencies, and illness is a basic
right.  Giving employees one paid sick day a semester would discourage them
from working while sick and endangering their peers.
