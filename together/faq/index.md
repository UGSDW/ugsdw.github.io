# Expansion FAQ

### Why are we expanding?

Workers deserve a voice. Without student workers, there would be no food, no
library, no mentor sessions, no mail delivery. We do vital work for the
college. Some students work 20 hours a week. We should have a say in how we
work.

Grinnell has always valued self-governance. College president George Gates 
famously said that "It is 10,000 times better that young people should learn to 
govern themselves." Despite this, self-governance is notably absent in 
the workplace. Wages and hours are set arbitrarily by the administration, and
[jobs can disappear without notice or discussion](/2017/08/26/statement-on-the-closing-of-bob-s-underground-cafe-and-lyle-s-pub/).

UGSDW can provide a voice to student workers. Together, we can advocate for our
common goals in a way that has not been possible before. We have an opportunity
to fundamentally rethink the relationship between student labor and the college.
Let's seize it.


### What has UGSDW achieved in the past?  What can we hope to gain through a union?

By expanding UGSDW, we hope to give every student employee a voice in their own
employment through collective bargaining. Collective bargaining allows us to
come together, determine our priorities, and sit across the table from the
administration to negotiate a contract about the terms and conditions of our
work, including pay and disciplinary policies. 

Through collective bargaining, student employees in Dining Services have
negotiated base pay raises from $8.50 to $9.76 per hour, a bonus system that 
rewards experience, guaranteed rest breaks, food safety training, and a 
grievance procedure.

### How do we get union representation and a contract?

Once 30% of student workers (not including those in Dining Services) join UGSDW,
we can file for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
If the union wins a majority of votes in the election, Grinnell must start
negotiating a contract with student workers right away.

We've [challenged](/assets/news/open_letter.pdf) the Grinnell administration to 
sign a [Neutrality and Card Check Agreement](/assets/news/neutrality.pdf),
which would force the college to remain neutral throughout the process, and to
recognize the union once we've received the support of a majority of student
workers. We believe it's important to allow students to decide the question
of union representation themselves, free from intimidation from the college
administration.


### Can I be fired for joining UGSDW?

It's illegal for Grinnell to retaliate or discriminate against you in any way
for union activity.  There's an entire government agency, the [National Labor
Relations Board](http://www.nlrb.gov), dedicated to protecting 
[your right](/members/rights) to have a say at work.

We don't send the College a list of our members.  Your name and signature will
be reviewed and counted by a neutral third party or the NLRB.



### How is UGSDW different from SGA?

SGA can play a meaningful role in enhancing the workplace experience of student
employees, but the college is under no obligation to accept SGA's
recommendations or requests. On the other hand, the administration has a legal
obligation to bargain with us, represented by UGSDW, as equals over things like
wages and workplace protections. In fact, SGA has passed a resolution in
support of UGSDW this past semester.


### I like my work and my supervisor. Why would I want a union? 

Right now, the administration can change
workplace policies at any time without consulting any student. In other words,
without a contract, we have no security and no seat at the table when decisions
affecting our lives and work are made by administrators. Just last year, the
administration arbitrarily closed down two workplaces on campus, Bob's
Underground Cafe and Lyle's Pub. 

Besides, when some of us are happy with our working conditions, others may not
be. Joining UGSDW enables you to support underprivileged student workers and
give them a voice: with a union, we get to negotiate a contract that will
protect the benefits we like and secure improvements in areas where we would
like to see progress. 


### Can one union contract accommodate so many different departments at Grinnell? 

Definitely.  There are no limits on what our contract can and can't do (within
the law, of course).  Most of the union contract deals with things like
grievance procedures, rights of employees and of the college, and things like
dues deductions and notifications about changes to work rules.  All of these
things can and should be standardized across departments.  Wages are relatively
standardized and can easily be broken down at the department level.  Last,
additional rules or provisions that apply only to specific departments could be
included should it become necessary.

### If the union wins more benefits for student employees, won't Grinnell have to make more cuts elsewhere? 

Not necessarily.  The college has 
[A LOT](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Grinnell%20College%20-%20Final%20Financial%20Statements%20-%20Short.pdf) 
of money, and can largely choose to do
whatever it wants with it.  They also build flexibility into their budget for
unexpected developments like recessions or minimum wage laws.  Financial aid is
central to Grinnell's mission.  The new admissions building? Maybe not as much.
We certainly think that paying employees a fair wage should be a higher
priority than some of the College's current expenditures.


### I heard the administration say student workers are not employees. Why? 

Grinnell doesn't want student workers to unionize.  To stop us, they're trying
a controversial legal tactic—claiming we're not employees, and so not covered
by federal labor law.  This would strip us of our right to organize, and their
obligation to listen to us.  They're hoping that Trump appointees on the labor
board will side with them to deny us rights.


### I like my supervisor. Wouldn't joining UGSDW upset them?

Your supervisor wants a happy, productive workplace.  They understand the
stress that student employment puts on you.  Many supervisors support higher
wages (after all, they're not paying for them out of pocket).  Joining UGSDW
isn't a statement about your supervisor.  It's a statement about wanting a
voice in discussions with the college administration.


### What about dues?

UGSDW has no mandatory dues—we understand that paying dues may be too much for 
some members.  For those who are willing and able, we [suggest
monthly dues of $2.00](/members/dues/) to help pay for things like our 
website, printing, mailing, and food.  All officers, Board members, and union 
reps serve unpaid so that your money goes to the most important things.
There are no dues in January, June, July, and August.


### Which workers will be represented?

Any student who works a job on campus or receives a paycheck from Grinnell
College would be represented by UGSDW.


### Can international students participate in the union? 

Absolutely! Many of our members and several of our officers are international
students. Joining a union has absolutely no impact on your immigration status
or work visa.


### Why doesn't UGSDW change its name now that it seeks to represent students outside Dining Services?

We're focused on giving student workers a voice.  Changing our name would
involve a lot of administrative headaches that would detract from this—buying a
new website, re-filing taxes and many government documents, changing our bank
account, editing hundreds of documents, and more.  We're also proud of our
union being the first independent undergraduate union the the country, and
don't want to confuse people with a name change.
