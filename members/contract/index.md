<br> <br>

# Updates
This contract expired in July 2020.  It hasn’t been replaced with a new contract because the union and the college have been at [impasse](/2020/10/15/dining-unit-members-reject-college-s-final-offer/) since October 2020.  The main disagreement still is over wages - the college insists on offering no raise at all - you can learn about that fight [here](/campaigns/dining). Although the contract is expired, many of its provisions still apply, as do the new provisions agreed on during negotiations.  Those new provisions are in the Student Handbook, which all workers receive a copy of, and are explained here in our [Handbook Explainer](/assets/explainer.pdf).

The parties agree that any matter covered by the Grinnell College nondiscrimination policies will not be subject to the grievance provision in this Agreement.

A student employee shall be notified in writing for each instance of point accruement; the notification shall also inform the student employee in question of the grievance procedure in this Agreement, and their right to union representation.  Point accruements for work rule violations must be for just cause.

The College agrees that no employee shall be disciplined or retaliated against for exercising their right to union representation.  Alleged violations of this Section 7.3 shall not be subject to the grievance provision in this Agreement.  Each semester, the Union shall provide the College with a list of union representatives and their contact information.

## ARTICLE VIII: Grievances

**8.1	General Policy.**  The College and the Union both aim to provide a simple, efficient and cost-effective mechanism for resolving disagreements that may arise under this Agreement.

**8.2	Grievance Procedure.**  Should any employee assert that the College has violated a provision of this Agreement, such claim will be considered a grievance to be resolved under this provision.  A grievance may only be raised by an employee adversely affected by the alleged violation. In each step, “working days” shall mean weekdays on which classes occur at the College.

**Step One.**  The aggrieved employee and/or a union representative shall raise the concern with their supervisor within ten (10) working days after knowledge of the action that allegedly violated the contract.  The supervisor or a designee shall respond within ten (10) working days.

**Step Two.**  If the matter is not resolved at Step One the grievance will be reduced to writing and presented to the director of Dining Services.  The director or a designee shall respond within five (5) working days.

**Step Three.**  If the matter is not resolved in Step Two, the grievance will be presented to the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources within five (5) working days. The Assistant Vice President of Human Resources or her designee shall respond within ten (10) working days. If the grievance is not resolved at Step Three it will be submitted to binding arbitration.

If the grievance involves a termination, the grievance process may begin at Step Two.  In such a case, the matter must be presented to the director of Dining Services within ten (10) working days after knowledge of the action that allegedly violated the contract.  Back pay may only be awarded as a remedy for an unfair termination grievance for shifts missed between the date the grievance is filed and the date the grievance is resolved.

**8.3	Arbitration.** If the grievance is not resolved at Step Three the Union may request arbitration on behalf of the aggrieved employee by submitting a written request to the Vice President of Human Resources within three (3) working days of receiving the Step Three response.

The Dean of Students shall serve as the arbitrator.  The Dean shall conduct a hearing and decide the grievance based upon the terms of this Agreement and College policies and practices.  The Dean shall have no power to amend, ignore or modify the terms of this Agreement.
