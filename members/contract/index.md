The parties to this Agreement will cooperate fully to secure the advancement and achievement of these purposes.

**3.2 Mutual   Responsibility.**  The College and Union agree that they will treat each other with mutual respect and dignity. Members of the College Community shall have the right to express their views concerning the terms and conditions of employment consistent with Grinnell College’s policies (including but not limited to Grinnell College’s Student Handbook, Staff Handbook, and Faculty Handbook), the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), financial aid regulations, privacy regulations, and other state and federal laws and regulations.

**3.3   College Rights.**  Subject only to the terms of this Agreement, the College (a) maintains the absolute right to carry out the educational mission of the institution, and (b) shall be the sole judge of all matters pertaining to student employment including the location and scheduling of such employment; the assignment and selection process; making and enforcing reasonable rules concerning safety, health, and the preservation of the educational experience; academic freedom; and the contracting out of work. The College reserves sole judgment regarding issues involving the academic mission of the College and academic freedom. These issues include, but are not limited to: (1) conditions and requirements for admission of students to educational or degree programs; (2) matters that pertain to the amount of any tuition, fees, awards or student benefits (provided that they are not terms and conditions of employment); (3) matters that pertain to the merits, necessity, existence, or organizational structure of any academic unit, department, field, program, or course established, eliminated or modified by the College; (4) decisions relating to student financial aid awards and tuition (provided that they are not terms and conditions of employment); (5) decisions relating to the creation and elimination of Student-Worker positions, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1; (6) decisions relating to the number of Student Workers employed by the College; (7) decisions relating to the number of internships, research fellowships, or Mentored Advanced Programs and the criteria for the granting of appointments; (8) decisions on students’ academic standing or progress (including withdrawal for academic reasons); (9) matters that pertain to degree, academic and certificate requirements; (10) matters pertaining to course assignment, content, teaching methods and supervision of courses, curricula and research programs. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or impair the right of the College to exercise its own discretion on all of the following matters, whatever may be the effect upon employment, when in its sole discretion it may determine it advisable to do any or all of the following: (a) adopt
work rules, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, (b) manage the College, (c) discipline or terminate employees, subject to the provisions of Article 4 of this Agreement (d) schedule work and determine schedules, (e) decide how to provide services to Grinnell College students, (f) maintain order and efficiency in its plants and operations, (g) hire, layoff, assign, transfer and

Any Student Worker participating in such conduct is subject to discipline and may be discharged from their position for such participation. It will not be a cause for discharge or discipline and it will not be a violation of this Agreement for a Student Worker to refuse to cross a primary labor union picket line at the College’s premises that has been established to support a legal strike, provided the picket line is approved by the Union. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to prohibit the Union from engaging in any Non-Strike Demonstration consistent with the policies contained within the Grinnell College Student Handbook. If the Union does engage in any Non-Strike Demonstration, it shall clearly and repeatedly advise all participants that the demonstration is for informational purposes only and cannot prevent or discourage any Student Worker from participating in work.
