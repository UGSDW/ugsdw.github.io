The parties to this Agreement will cooperate fully to secure the advancement and achievement of these purposes.

**3.2 Mutual Responsibility.** The College and Union agree that they will treat each other with mutual respect and dignity. Members of the College Community shall have the right to express their views concerning the terms and conditions of employment consistent with Grinnell College’s policies (including but not limited to Grinnell College’s Student Handbook, Staff Handbook, and Faculty Handbook), the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), financial aid regulations, privacy regulations, and other state and federal laws and regulations.

**3.3 College Rights.** Subject only to the terms of this Agreement, the College (a) maintains the absolute right to carry out the educational mission of the institution, and (b) shall be the sole judge of all matters pertaining to student employment including the location and scheduling of such employment; the assignment and selection process; making and enforcing reasonable rules concerning safety, health, and the preservation of the educational experience; academic freedom; and the contracting out of work. 

The College reserves sole judgment regarding issues involving the academic mission of the College and academic freedom. These issues include, but are not limited to: (1) conditions and requirements for admission of students to educational or degree programs; (2) matters that pertain to the amount of any tuition, fees, awards or student benefits (provided that they are not terms and conditions of employment); (3) matters that pertain to the merits, necessity, existence, or organizational structure of any academic unit, department, field, program, or course established, eliminated or modified by the College; (4) decisions relating to student financial aid awards and tuition (provided that they are not terms and conditions of employment); (5) decisions relating to the creation and elimination of Student-Worker positions, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1; (6) decisions relating to the number of Student Workers employed by the College; (7) decisions relating to the number of internships, research fellowships, or Mentored Advanced Programs and the criteria for the granting of appointments; (8) decisions on students’ academic standing or progress (including withdrawal for academic reasons); (9) matters that pertain to degree, academic and certificate requirements; (10) matters pertaining to course assignment, content, teaching methods and supervision of courses, curricula and research programs.

Any Student Worker participating in such conduct is subject to discipline and may be discharged from their position for such participation. It will not be a cause for discharge or discipline and it will not be a violation of this Agreement for a Student Worker to refuse to cross a primary labor union picket line at the College’s premises that has been established to support a legal strike, provided the picket line is approved by the Union. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to prohibit the Union from engaging in any Non-Strike Demonstration consistent with the policies contained within the Grinnell College Student Handbook. If the Union does engage in any Non-Strike Demonstration, it shall clearly and repeatedly advise all participants that the demonstration is for informational purposes only and cannot prevent or discourage any Student Worker from participating in work.

During the term of this Agreement, the College shall not engage in any Lockout against the Union or the Student Workers covered by this Agreement.

This provision incorporates the following definitions:

Notice and an opportunity to bargain shall only be required when the aforementioned changes occur during an academic semester or within 15 work days prior to the commencement of an academic semester. Notice provided pursuant to this section shall exclude information protected by Title VII, and Title IX.

## ARTICLE 4—JUST CAUSE
**4.1 Just Cause.** Student Workers shall not be disciplined or discharged without just cause. Just cause shall be assessed based upon the seven generally recognized elements of notice, reasonableness, investigation, fairness, proof, consistency, and appropriateness of discipline, taking into account all of the circumstances of the matter.

**4.2 Notice of Discipline.** Student Workers retain the right to provide or withhold notice to the Union of any disciplinary action taken against them pursuant to Article 4, subject to the limitations provided in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3.

**4.3 Just Cause: Progressive Discipline.** Except as set forth in Section 5.4, the College will employ a three-step progressive discipline process:

_Step One:_ The Student Worker receives an oral warning. The oral warning shall be documented, with notice provided to the Student Worker. 

Informal, undocumented coaching and correction shall not serve as a Step One discipline. The parties acknowledge that informal training and learning are mutual responsibilities of the College and Union.

_Step Two:_ The Student Worker receives a written warning. 

_Step Three:_ The Student Worker must attend a disciplinary meeting with the Office of Student Employment, which may result in termination. The Student Worker may request to have a union representative or workplace steward present at the disciplinary meeting. A Student Worker’s failure to attend a disciplinary meeting may result in immediate termination, at the College’s discretion.
 
**4.4 Just Cause: Immediate Termination.** The College may, without prior notice, place any Student Worker on investigatory leave in order to review or investigate allegations of the following misconduct: (1) Willful falsification of employment application, time card or other College records; (2) Gross negligence that results in material injury to property, person, or public relations; (3) Theft, assault, or any other criminal act; (4) Harassment of others; (5) Violation of the College’s Title IX, non-discrimination, or confidentiality policies; and (6) Refusal to perform assigned duties. 

After a Student Worker is placed on investigatory leave, the College shall perform a factual investigation of the allegations of misconduct. If the College deems the allegations are founded, the Student Worker may be immediately terminated. Student Workers shall receive pay during the investigatory leave. This pay shall be the greater of 1) the amount which the Student Worker would have earned had they not been placed on investigatory leave, based on their scheduled hours, or 2) the amount earned by the Student Worker during the last full pay period prior to the investigatory leave, prorated by the number of days the Student Worker is placed on investigatory leave.

Section 4.3 shall not govern terminations pursuant to this Section. 

**4.5 Union Presence.** Student Workers may request the presence of a union steward during any formal investigative interview that may result in discipline or discharge. The College agrees to remind Student Workers of this right before any formal disciplinary meeting. Student Workers have the right to not have a union steward present.

**4.6 Academic Positions.** For purposes of this Agreement, Academic Positions shall be defined as all (1) Course Assistant, (2) Lab Assistant, (3) Teaching Assistant, (4) Mentor, (5) Research Assistant, (6) Grader, and (7) Tutor positions held by Student Workers. Student Workers in Academic Positions retain the rights enumerated in Sections 4.1, 4.3, and 4.4. However, because of the educational nature of Academic Positions, Student Workers in Academic Positions must also meet the appropriate standards of academic excellence set forth in Section 4.7.  

**4.7 Academic Excellence.** As an essential duty of their positions, Student Workers in Academic Positions must demonstrate an ability to perform, achieve, and excel in the scholastic activities related to their employment. A Student Worker in an Academic Position’s failure to meet standards of academic excellence could compromise the educational value other students receive from their courses or the progress faculty make in their research. If a Student Worker in an Academic Position is deemed by their supervisor to have significantly compromised the educational value of a course or progress of a research project, the supervisor shall prepare a statement explaining the concern and identifying the damage that would be caused by retaining the Student Worker. The statement shall be presented in writing to the Student Worker. The Student Worker must then attend a meeting with the supervisor, which may result in termination. The Student Worker may request to have a union representative or workplace steward present at the meeting. A Student Worker’s failure to attend the meeting may result in immediate termination.

Examples of proper reasons for a Student Worker’s removal from and Academic Position pursuant to Section 4.7 include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) The Student Worker does not adequately understand the academic content of a course and this shortcoming cannot be rectified in a reasonable period of time (relative to the length of the semester). (2) The Student Worker does not possess adequate communication skills to effectively assist other students. (3) The Student Worker repeatedly misrepresents course procedures (e.g. deadlines or details about assignments) to the detriment of students in the course. 

**4.10 Service Leadership Work Study.** The Service-Leadership Work Study (“SLWS”) Program is supported by the Center for Careers, Life, and Service at Grinnell College and is designed to create reciprocal relationships between Grinnell community organizations, community members, and Grinnell College students through collaborative service-learning and action. SLWS students are hired by Grinnell College to serve in capacity building service positions that support efforts to improve the wellbeing of our larger community. Students apply to the program and are interviewed and selected by non-profit or governmental community partner host organizations and, after being hired by the College, serve at their host site. As per federal regulations, SLWS positions are specifically designed in a manner that does not replace work that would otherwise be done by paid community employees, but rather would be the purview of a volunteer.  

Both parties recognize that students choosing to participate in Service Leadership Work Study positions are volunteers within the host organizations and subject to the terms and conditions of the host organization’s volunteer policies and the SLWS Memorandum of Understanding. Community Partner Host Organizations shall not be bound by this Agreement. As such, discipline and removal of Student Workers by the Community Partner Host Organizations are not governed by Section 4.3 or Section 4.4.

**4.11 Student Government Association.** As the elected or appointed representatives of the entire student body, the Student Government Association (“SGA”), is comprised to serve and represent every student at Grinnell College. SGA is bound by the Articles of its Constitution. 

The parties jointly acknowledge that, in the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the SGA Constitution, the SGA Constitution shall govern. Furthermore, impeachment and the subsequent removal of any Student Worker in an SGA position pursuant to the SGA Constitution shall not be subject to Section 4.3 and Section 4.4.
