during a scheduled working period without securing a replacement they will accrue .5 points.

missed (if any). If an employee misses more than ten (10) minutes of a scheduled shift due to correcting a
uniform, they will accrue .5 points. If an employee does not return in proper uniform, the missed shift will be treated as an absence and the student will accrue one (1) point.

employee shall be notified in writing for each instance of point accruement; the notification shall also
inform the student employee in question of the grievance procedure in this Agreement, and their right to
union representation. Point accruements for work rule violations must be for just cause. Point totals will reset every academic period.

The College agrees that no employee shall be disciplined or retaliated against for exercising their right to union representation.
