# Experience Pay
Under our contract, you can receive experience bonuses if you work at least
**110 hours** in a semester. The size of the bonus depends on the number of
hours worked and whether or not you’ve earned a bonus previously.  You can read
the details in [the contract](/members/contract/#article-iv-wages).

To track the number of hours you’ve worked in a semester:

- Set up an account with Paycor.
    1. [Go to their registration page](https://secure.paycor.com/Accounts/UserRegistration/Register).
    1. Type in your last name and provide **75372** as the access code.
    1. Follow their instructions to finish creating your account.  The email
       with the verification code can take up to 20 minutes to be sent, so be
       patient.
- View your pay stubs.
    1. [Log in to Paycor](https://secure.paycor.com/Accounts/Authentication/Signin).
    1. Click on ‘View Check Stubs.’
- Calculate your total hours for this semester.
    - If this is your first semester working for Grinnell College:
      1. From the drop down menu, choose the most recent pay stub.
      1. Look  for the column labelled “YTD HR/UNIT.” The value in this column is
         the number of hours you have worked this semester.
    - If you have worked for Grinnell College before the start of this semester:
      1. From the drop down menu, choose the last pay stub of the previous
         semester.  This will either be 12/30 or 6/15.
      1. Look  for the column labelled “YTD HR/UNIT.”  Write down the number in
         the column.
      1. Go back to the drop down menu and choose the most recent pay stub.
      1. Subtract the value you wrote down earlier from the value in the “YTD
         HR/UNIT” column. This is the total number of hours you have worked this
         semester.  For example, if the YTD HR/UNIT was 145.19 on 6/15/2016, but
         is now 168.36,  you have worked 168.36 – 145.19 = 23.17 hours this
         semester.
