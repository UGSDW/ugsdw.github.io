# Dues

UGSDW has suggested dues of $2.00 per month.

The easiest way to pay dues is by filling out the Dues Check-Off Authorization form. Grinnell will automatically deduct dues from your paycheck. You can also pay dues with Paypal, $2/month, $8/semester, or $16/year. We do not collect dues in January, June, July, or August.

Finally, dues can be paid by cash or check.  If you are paying by check,
make the check payable to “Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers” and write
the month(s) for which you are paying dues on the memo line.  If you are paying
cash, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZ-FInxs2UBlypa_jADZxgvdgZnL1USMqziMtN2wimg/export?format=pdf)
and attach the cash to it.
