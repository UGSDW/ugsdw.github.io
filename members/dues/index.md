The easiest way to pay dues is to use Venmo, and to pay your dues for the entire semester ($8.00) or year ($16.00) at a time. You can also pay dues with Paypal.

Another way to pay dues if you currently have a job is to fill out a dues check-off form.  Grinnell will automatically deduct dues from your paycheck.

Finally, dues can be paid by cash or check.  If you are paying by check,
make the check payable to “Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers” and write
the month(s) for which you are paying dues on the memo line.  If you are paying
cash, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZ-FInxs2UBlypa_jADZxgvdgZnL1USMqziMtN2wimg/export?format=pdf)
and attach the cash to it.
