If you work in the dining hall, the easiest way to pay dues is to fill out a dues check-off form.  Grinnell will automatically deduct dues from your paycheck.

Dues can also be paid by check, cash, Venmo, or PayPal.  If you are paying by check,
make the check payable to “Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers” and write
the month(s) for which you are paying dues on the memo line.  If you are paying
cash, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZ-FInxs2UBlypa_jADZxgvdgZnL1USMqziMtN2wimg/export?format=pdf)
and attach the cash to it.
