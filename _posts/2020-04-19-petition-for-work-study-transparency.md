As Grinnell College student workers, across departments, we demand transparency into the work study grant determination process. We are asking for the specific formulas applied to determine the grants on a case-by-case basis. We also demand an appeal process so students who were given insufficient grants have a chance to help fix that mistake. You can sign the petition [here!](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/grinnell-college-work-study-transparency)

**Why is this important?**

On April 6th and 7th, Grinnell College announced grants to help student workers who have lost essential income because they can no longer work. However, many workers have reported receiving grants that were much too small for their needs. What were their processes to determine these grants? In the economic downturn and widespread chaos of this pandemic, we have the right to transparency in the decisions that are affecting our financial status. Furthermore, there is no appeal process for student workers whose grants do not accurately reflect their needs. To the Grinnell College administration, a few hundred dollars here and there may not seem significant. To a displaced student worker with mounting debt and a shattered income, any dollar amount makes a difference. Many Grinnell students rely on their work not just to pay tuition, but for rent and food, and now that they donâ€™t have the opportunity to work, their need is urgent.
