Members of the Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers (UGSDW) voted Sunday to begin a work-to-rule campaign intended to raise awareness of unfair pay and to put pressure on Grinnell College to raise wages.  UGSDW president Cory McCartan issued the following statement:

“For the last four months, UGSDW has tried to reach agreement on a new contract with Grinnell College that provides an adequate wage for student workers. In addition to being unfair, low wages have led to understaffing and venue closures. Now, without a new contract, our members are forced to work without contract protections and subject to the whims of the Grinnell administration.  We therefore strongly encourage our members and allies to follow all work rules to the letter, and to abide by all health and safety laws, regardless of the effect on speed of service.

“We regret the inconvenience this causes to members of the campus community. Hopefully the Grinnell administration will soon recognize the importance of fair wages to the proper operation of Dining Services.  When tuition goes up, wages should too.”
