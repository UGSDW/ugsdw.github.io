#### Press Release

To the courageous Kenyon Student Worker Organizing Committee members and strike participants: 

![KSWOC.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/KSWOC.png)

The Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers stands in solidarity with you in your strike for recognition. We admire and congratulate your strong displays of collective action â€” especially in face of the illegal and threatening use of campus safety by the Kenyon College administration. The fact that your strike only gained momentum after the College attempted to intimidate and harass striking workers demonstrates to workers everywhere that when we come together, we all win. Your strike also demonstrates to administrators everywhere that they are not above the law, and college policies will never supersede our basic rights to organize, collectively bargain, and build workplaces that work for us. 
 
While we are enraged that these fights for basic recognition are even necessary, we also know fights like these are never completely over. UGSDW will always stand in solidarity with workers at Kenyon and around the globe. 


In solidarity and rage,

The Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers
