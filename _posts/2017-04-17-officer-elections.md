UGSDW officer elections are held the first Saturday in May every year.
This year, elections will be held on **Saturday, May 6, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in JRC 209.** All four Executive Board positions will be elected to a term of one year.

All members are eligible to run for any one of these positions, and members can run on a split ticket: one person to serve during the fall semester, the other during the spring; however, members can only be nominated for one position.  Nominations should be sent to <ugsdw.org@gmail.com> by **3:59 pm on Friday, May 5th**, and union members are welcome to nominate themselves. 

The election will be conducted through a rank-choice (instant runoff) system, with voters ranking their preferences for each office.  After the voting period ends, the top candidates for each position will be elected.
