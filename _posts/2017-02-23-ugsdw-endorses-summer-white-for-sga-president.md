GRINNELL, IOWA — The Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers today endorsed
Summer White for SGA President.  Earlier this week, the Union asked for
statements from each of the candidates about student labor on campus.  After
conversations with union members, the Executive Board of the union unanimously
voted to endorse Ms. White.


“While all the candidates were well-qualified and had pro-labor positions that
would be beneficial to student workers, Summer’s experience in SGA as well as
her clearly articulated policy goals and strong support of UGSDW make her the
best choice for president” said Alec Doss, vice president.  “We look forward to
working more closely with SGA in the future.”
