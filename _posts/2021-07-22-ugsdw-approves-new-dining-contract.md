#### Press Release

***

On Thursday, July 8th, 2021, UGSDW membership voted unanimously to approve a new contract. While UGSDW has previously re-negotiated our contract with Dining Services every year, this contract has a two-year term; it will be in effect from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2023.

The new contract includes several significant wins for our membership. In year 1 of the contract, the initial base wage will increase from $10 to $10.40 per hour. In year 2, this base wage will increase to $10.75. Student leaders will now receive $1 per hour extra rather than $.75.


Dining workers should also take note of changes to experience pay. If students have worked more than 90 hours in a singular semester, they are eligible for an additional “experienced student” bonus worth $1 per hour. However, to receive this raise, you will need to apply before the beginning of a semester. UGSDW leadership will remind students to apply for this bonus before each semester begins. 

The new contract also includes a restructured point system allowing workers more flexibility. Although the points each employee is allowed to accrue each semester have decreased from 5 to 3, workers are now able to pick up additional shifts within the same time period of a shift they missed to avoid accruing a point. 

The new contract also includes several minor changes such as a modification to how UGSDW may recruit members during New Student Orientation. Members are encouraged to read the contract in its entirety: The contract is available online [here](https://www.ugsdw.org/members/contract/) and will also be emailed to membership.

If you have any questions or concerns about the new contract, we encourage you to email ugsdw.org@gmail.com. 

UGSDW remains committed to advocating for better wages and working conditions for ALL student workers on campus.
