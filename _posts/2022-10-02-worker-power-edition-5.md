## Divided We Beg, United We Bargain

First Bargaining Session: October 6, 4:30 PM — JRC 101; Come Watch Negotiations!

### Stand in Solidarity! Bargaining is Open to All

This Thursday, years of organizing will culminate with the beginning of our bargaining process. Make no mistake — the only way that we've gotten here is through the organizing that we’ve done together. The College has shown us time and time again that they won't meet workers' needs unless we force them to. The only power we have to win our demands is the power that we've won through organizing — the power that we have at the bargaining table.

The College has tried everything in its power to make bargaining inaccessible for student workers. They’ve repeatedly proposed restrictive ground rules, like putting the bargaining teams in a room isolated from the audience, limiting our electronic communication during the meeting, and even cancelling bargaining sessions if any "disruptions" occur. 

We have the right to a fair, open bargaining process. We want all student workers to hear the College tell us to our faces that they don’t think we deserve fair wages and real job protections. The College is terrified that the entire campus community will show up in solidarity with our demands for a living wage, real recourse, and job security — let’s prove them right.

Student workers need every member of the campus community to show up this Thursday, Oct. 6, to our first bargaining session in JRC 101 or on [this Webex](https://grinnellcollege.webex.com/grinnellcollege/j.php?MTID=m8652ba370635ef63d3ab7b42e109c9f7) at 4:30 PM wearing a UGSDW Fair Contract Now button.
 
Show the College that we are watching and willing to take action to fight for what we need. Show the College we are united in our demands and in this fight!
