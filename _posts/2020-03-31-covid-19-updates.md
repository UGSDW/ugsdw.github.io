Dear UGSDW Members:

I hope you're all safe and well. I want to update you all on how the union is adapting to our new, physically distant situation. 

**Student Work Policies**

We are still in contact with administrators to get clarity on the policies related to student employment, and we hope to publish some helpful information soon. For now, let us know if you have any questions and we'll try to help. You can reach union representatives at union@ugsdw.org.

**COVID-19 Student Worker Survey**

As the work environment is changing, we want to make sure we know what your work situations are like, what issues you're facing, and what our ability to take action to improve them is. To get this information, we've made a [survey](https://forms.gle/efvfjbrB4NHq3Vpn7). Please fill it out, no matter what your work situation is now! This is super important.

**Online Union Meeting**

Finally, we'll be having a digital general meeting on **Sunday, April 12 at 4pm EST.** More details on the platform and the agenda will come later but please plan to be there! 

Even more than usual, please reach out if you need help, have questions, or have an idea to help other workers. Our solidarity and community is so important right now.

In solidarity,

Jacob Schneyer 

President, UGSDW
