GRINNELL, IOWA — The Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers (UGSDW) Executive Board stands in full and unwavering solidarity with student workers at the Grinnell College Student Publications and Radio Committee (SPARC). SPARC student workers have learned that the College is going to eliminate their printed editions for the next academic year, a move made without consulting student workers or the Union. The Executive Board is firmly against the action by the administration and will be working with SPARC student workers to save their printed editions.  

The move to eliminate printed editions, such as the Scarlet & Black newspaper which has printed for 130 years, is contrary to the mission of the College. The Executive Board promises to fight for SPARC workers both at and beyond the bargaining table. Specifically, the Union will utilize section 3.10 of the contract in effect, which allows the Union to bargain over the effects of major workplace changes. Furthermore, the Union will convene the Union-Management Committee to directly speak to College representatives about the matter. UGSDW Co-Presidents Conrad Dahm and Hannah Sweet said about the news “We are firmly against the move to eliminate print positions. As Grinnellians, we both appreciate the services SPARC student workers make to the College. As Union leaders, we promise to fight for all SPARC workers to the best of our ability, and use all available tools at our disposal to ensure publications can remain printed.”
