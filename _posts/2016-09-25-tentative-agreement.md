The Contract Bargaining Team today unanimously recommended the tentative
collective bargaining agreement reached with Grinnell College.  Highlights of
the contract:

 - **Base wage of $9.25 for all employees, $10.00 for student leaders.**
 - Tiered experience bonuses that raise your base wage in 25-cent increments
   over three semesters if you commit to working 110 hours.
 - A grievance procedure
 - Better food safety training
 - Protection against being fired without just cause
 - Guaranteed rest and meal breaks
 - The contract covers all Grinnell College students who work in the
   Marketplace, and will hopefully soon cover all high school students that
   work similar shifts.  If ratified, the new wages will take effect on October 1.

The contract ratification vote will be held on **Tuesday, September 27 at 9 p.m.
in JRC 101.**
