title: Members Unanimously Reject College Proposal

In a special meeting UGSDW members unanimously rejected the College's final
proposal for the 2017-2018 contract. The college offered a paltry ten cent
raise, but only starting in 2018. The members have communicated to the college
that, for now, they will not accept a wage below $9.60, a cost of living
adjustment that matched the increase in Grinnellâ€™s comprehensive fee for the
2017-18 academic year. The college has refused to recognize that the wages that
we make go directly to paying for food and other amenities that we need to
attend Grinnell, which only becomes harder and harder as tuition is increased
year over year.
