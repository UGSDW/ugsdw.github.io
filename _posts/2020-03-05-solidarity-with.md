### *Student workers stand in solidarity with Indeginous people in their struggle.*

The Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers stands in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation and the Unist’ot’en house group in their struggle against the construction of Coastal GasLink pipeline (CGL) on their sovereign, unceded territory in so-called “British Columbia” without their consent. Since 2007, the Wet’suwet’en First Nation has been resisting the encroachments of all pipeline developments. In their fight, members of the Unist’ot’en house group have repeatedly been subject to violent raids by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 

Grinnell College operates on land stolen from Meskwaki, Sauk, and Ioway Nations, and many of the student workers are settlers on this land. It is our responsibility to support movements that defend the right of Indigenous peoples to their land.  

We encourage student workers to educate themselves and others on the historical and ongoing processes of settler-colonization against Indigenous peoples both where we live and across the world, and to support efforts that seek to disrupt settler-colonial systems.
