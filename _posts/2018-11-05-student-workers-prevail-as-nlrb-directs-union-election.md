### *UGSDW poised to make history as members prepare for Nov. 27 secret ballot election*


GRINNELL, IOWA — On Monday, November 5, the Regional Director of the National Labor Review Board (NLRB) published a decision about our [recent hearing and case](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/18-RC-228797).  For two straight days, the College and its union-busting lawyers at Nyemaster Goode, Iowa’s largest law firm, argued that unionization and collective bargaining would ruin the College’s educational mission and harm students. In a landmark ruling, the NLRB rejected their argument, calling it "unpersuasive" and "unavailing."

Moving forward, the NLRB will conduct a secret ballot election in which employees will vote whether or not they wish to be represented for purposes of collective bargaining by UGSDW. The election will be held on Tuesday, November 27, 2018 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Grinnell College, 1115 8th Avenue, Grinnell, IA in the Joe Rosenfield Center, Room 101.

On Tuesday, Grinnell College announced their intention to appeal the NLRB’s decision, warning that “collective bargaining and the potential resort to the economic threat of a strike or lockout would fundamentally change the educational nature of a relationship between students and an institution of higher education.” The College administration’s threat once again demonstrates its unwillingness to accept democratic results and practice the progressive values it champions. If administrators do not want a strike or lockout to occur, the College should accept the results of the NLRB decision and recognize our right to collectively bargain. UGSDW will continue to fight the College’s union-busting rhetoric and actions as we approach the election.

Should the results of the election be in UGSDW’s favor, the union will make national history. Grinnell will become home to the first completely-unionized undergraduate student body in the United States, leading the way for other student workers seeking the benefits, fair pay, and job security unions can offer.
