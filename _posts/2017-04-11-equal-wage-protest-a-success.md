On Monday, April 10, UGSDW members protested Grinnell's treatment of high
school dining workers.  Over the lunch hour, workers held signs, distributed
flyers, and collected signatures for a petition to the president of the
college.  The union gathered over 200 signatures, and raised awareness of the
college's outrageous behavior.

Before the protest, union members put up dozens of posters around the dining
hall, as well as at the Dining Services offices, the Old Glove Factory, and
Nollen House.  The petition and signatures will be delivered to Presdient
Kington later this week.
