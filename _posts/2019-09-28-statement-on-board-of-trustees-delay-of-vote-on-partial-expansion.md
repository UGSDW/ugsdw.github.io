### *Board of Trustees Delayed Vote Again; Student Workers Deeply Disappointed*


On September 27, in a campus update sent to all students, staff, and faculty of Grinnell College, the Board of Trustees announced that "there will not be a decision about limited expansion at the October Board meeting," further delaying a decision which was already postponed from the May Board meeting.

We are deeply disappointed by the Board's decision to further delay the already long over-due vote on partial expansion of union representation. The apparently endless delay is neither a viable nor sustainable resolution. We will vigorously engage in the input processes laid out by the Board so that the Board will accept a partial union expansion agreement as soon as possible. We will continue to organize and fight for all student workers.
