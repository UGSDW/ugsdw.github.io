**On Wednesday, April 8th, the UGSDW Executive Board sent an open letter to President Rayndard Kington detailing concerns about Grinnell Colleges response to the coronavirus crisis. Read the letter below:**

Dear President Kington,

The global spread of COVID-19 has drastically changed the Grinnell College landscape. While we
appreciate the necessity of distant learning, it has opened novel issues that, if left unaddressed, are
highly detrimental to student workers’ health and well-being. UGSDW reached out to student workers
to understand what their concerns are in this unprecedented time. Many expressed concerns over their
health working on campus, financial stability, and job accessibility. As the situation progresses and we
all have to adjust to this unusual circumstance, we demand that the College takes action to adapt to all
student and non-student workers’ needs. We are writing this letter and issuing these demands to speak
up for all workers in the Grinnell College community.

We demand that any further policies address the following pressing issues:

**Health and safety:** To ensure the health of not only workers themselves but also the
larger Grinnell community, Grinnell College must have workplace health protections
for all on-campus workers, including but not limited to paid sick leave and, when
appropriate, personal protective gear.

**Financial security:** Disruptions in work schedules have financially destabilized student
workers, who depended on their jobs to fulfill their work-study and other financial
needs. Grinnell College must ensure the financial stability of student workers by
instituting policies, including but not limited to expanding on-campus and remote job
opportunities and offering sufficient financial grant to replace lost income due to
COVID-19-related disruptions.

**Equitable employment practices:** Grinnell College must ensure that all policy changes
are applied equitably. For example, new job opportunities must be publicly accessible
to every student worker (e.g. on Handshake), and include clear expectations for
qualification, hours, tasks, and compensation.

**Transparency from administration:** We understand that the situation is changing
daily, but all student workers expect to be kept up-to-date during the decision-making
process on any student work arrangement for adequate student worker input.

Now more than ever, it is clear how student and non-student workers are essential to the College’s
functioning. We truly appreciate that Grinnell College has taken swift action to protect Grinnell College
students and the community at large, but unfortunately, student workers’ voices have not been fully
heard and their urgent concerns not addressed. True solutions that work for all will only come when
the decision-making process includes the workers most affected.

Respectfully,

UGSDW Executive Board
