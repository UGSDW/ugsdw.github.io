# Dining Campaign
Dining workers are currently fighting for $15 an hour.  While we were able to get some important wins through bargaining, including leave for COVID related absences, the college has refused to raise wages even during record understaffing.  Although they admit that they can afford to give us a raise, even to $100 per hour, they refuse to consider it at all.  Because of this, Dining workers are organizing to pressure administrators to reopen bargaining of the current contract. 15$ an hour would bring the dining hall in line with the pay of other similar jobs in town.

For more information on the current contract and recent wins, check out the [contract page](https://www.ugsdw.org/members/contract/).
