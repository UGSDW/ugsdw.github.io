# Dining Campaign
Dining workers are currently fighting for a fair contract.  While we were able to get some important wins through bargaining, including leave for COVID related absences, the college has refused to raise wages at all.  Although they admit that they can afford to give us a raise, even to $100 per hour, they refuse to consider it at all.  Because of this, Dining workers overwhelmingly rejected the collegeâ€™s final offer and continued to organize to pressure administrators to raise wages.

For more information on the current contract and recent wins, check out the [contract page](https://www.ugsdw.org/members/contract/).
